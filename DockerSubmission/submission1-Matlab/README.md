# Instructions

The MATLAB script `get_sepsis_score.m` makes predictions on the input data.

To run this script, start MATLAB and run

        get_sepsis_score('input.psv', 'output.psv')

which takes a text file `input.psv` as input and returns a text file `output.psv` as output.

The input files are provided in a training database available on the PhysioNet website, and the format for the output files is described on the PhysioNet website.
